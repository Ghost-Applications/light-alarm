# Light Alarm

Android alarm clock that uses the phones flashlight rather than making sounds.

Get the app from our [releases](https://github.com/Ghost-Applications/light-alarm), we recommend
using [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) to manage versioning.

Or you can grab it from the [Play Store]() ($5 because dealing with the play store is awful).
